 Sorting algorithms in C++:

The goal of this project is to implement selected sorting algorithms.
The objects to be sorted are placed in a free-access data structure.
The Sort function must be based on one of the following algorithms: ShellSort, QuickSort.
Funkcja StableSort musi opierać się na jednym z poniższych algorytmów: MergeSort, CountingSort.
Results of program operation for test sets placed in files with
files named "wczyt_danych_XX_output.txt".
The file named "wczyt_danych_XX_output.txt" contains: the result of the sort, the running time of each algorithm used in [ms].
